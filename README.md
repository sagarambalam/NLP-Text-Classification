## Problem Statement:
This is a Classification problem where we have to classify the text into one of the 12 categories.

## Approach:
1. EDA
  - Cleaning Data. (Tokenizing, Stemming, Stopward removal, Stemming)
  - Additional data cleaning based on data.
2. Building Model.
  - Baseline model using Naive Bayes.
  - Comparing with Random Forest.
3. Hyperparameter tuning.
  - Gridcvsearch
  - Visualising tuning results.
4. Predicting on test dataset.

## Future Scope:
1. Text cleaning based on domain expertise by expanding shortforms.
2. improving approach to split joint words and incorrect spaces
